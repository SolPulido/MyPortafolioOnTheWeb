      <p id="answer1">In this coding program I was told to create an interactive program that generates an output with the help of the user. This is one of my projects that I am most proud of because I liked the final product how well it was made and its ease of use, which helps create a complete paragraph with just a few words added by the user</p>

            <p id="answer2">This code program is on my list of pride because I liked practicing an AI chat or a chatbot, it was very interesting to build from the roots to create it in my opinion. Mostly use if , elif and else statements to create this program and it will provide different variants for the user.</p>

                <p id="answer3">This project was different from the others because I used another page and didn't replicate it like I usually had. This time I also created my first Code that will generate sound although it was difficult to work with this page but in the end I managed to create the rigntone the way I planned from the beginning.</p>
